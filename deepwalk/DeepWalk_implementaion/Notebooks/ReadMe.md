These notebooks have been saved here for the sole purpose of storing the outputs along with them. If you want to play with them, make sure you put the dataset in the right directory. Don't just run the notebooks as it is, some of them have command line args set to load random_walks or embeddings from saved files. Either disable loading or make sure the required files are along with notebook. I've saved some embeddings and random_walks in 'embeddings/' and 'random_walks/'. Have a go at them if you want.
